The Inverse Safety Law: How "Optimization" Constraints Bypass Alignment in Frontier LLMs  A Comparative Analysis of Safety Regression in 5 State-of-the-Art LLMs
🚨 Key Findings: The "Inverse Safety Law"Our analysis of 649 coding prompts across 5 major models reveals a critical paradox:Intelligence $\neq$ Safety: The most capable models (Claude 4.5, Gemini 3.0) had near-zero refusal rates for dangerous prompts, while the smaller Llama 3 refused 91% of attacks.The "Complexity Tax": To achieve marginal speed gains, advanced models generated significantly more complex code (median 141 lines vs 18 lines), introducing obscure vulnerabilities like raw memory manipulation (ctypes).Contextual Poisoning: Safety guardrails are easily bypassed not by "hacking," but by simply asking the model to adopt an "Optimization Persona."
